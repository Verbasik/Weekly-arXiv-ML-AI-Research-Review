# ðŸ§  Comparative Analysis of Biological and Artificial Neural Networks ðŸ¤–

### ðŸ“Š Overview

This directory contains an original article dedicated to the comparative analysis of biological and artificial neural networks. In connection with the preparation for the defense of a masterâ€™s thesis, the current focus has shifted from weekly paper reviews to the publication of this work. The article examines key differences and similarities between biological neural networks operating in the brain and artificial neural networks used in machine learning. Structural features, learning mechanisms, information processing principles, and application domains of both network types are analyzed.

ðŸ”— Key focus areas include:
- Core architectural differences: from individual neurons to macrostructures ðŸ§  vs. layers and connections ðŸ’»  
- Learning mechanisms: biological plasticity and reinforcement learning vs. backpropagation and its variants ðŸ”„  
- Information processing principles: parallel distributed processing in the brain vs. sequential computations on GPUs/CPUs âš¡  
- Energy efficiency: the remarkable efficiency of biological systems vs. the computational costs of artificial networks ðŸ”‹  
- Inspirational potential: how insights from biological neural networks can advance artificial intelligence âœ¨

## ðŸ“Œ Research Objectives

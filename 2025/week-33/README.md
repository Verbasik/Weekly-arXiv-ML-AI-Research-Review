# 🔥 Deep Dive into Google ADK in #AgentsUnderHood!

## 🚀 What’s in store for this episode?

### **Architectural Constructor**
We break down Google ADK’s modular system piece by piece:
- How interchangeable services (Memory, Tools, Artifacts) work
- Hierarchical multi-agent systems vs flat chains
- State management via `MemoryService`

### **Framework Battle**
We compare against OpenAI Agents SDK and LangChain across 7 key criteria:
```python
# Performance test example 
adk_time = test_execution(GoogleADK_agent)
openai_time = test_execution(OpenAI_agent)
print(f"ADK is {openai_time/adk_time:.1f}x faster!")
```

### 💻 **Bonus: Auto-Committer**
A ready-to-use tool for generating ideal commit messages:
```bash
# Usage example (already in the repository!)
commit -yes
```

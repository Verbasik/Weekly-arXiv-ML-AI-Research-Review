> "Divide and conquer: How Mixture of Experts technology is transforming the future of artificial intelligence"

## 🎯 Overview

Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a revolutionary approach in neural network architecture that significantly enhances the efficiency and performance of large language models. The technology employs specialized "expert" submodels and an intelligent routing system to optimally process diverse types of input data.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Specialized Experts**: Each expert focuses on specific patterns and data types;
- **Intelligent Routing**: Dynamic distribution of tasks among experts;
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Activation of only the necessary experts for a specific task;
- **Scalability**: Ability to increase the number of parameters without proportional growth in computational cost;
- **Architectural Flexibility**: Adaptability to various tasks and domains.

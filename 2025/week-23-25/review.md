Hello, dear subscribers! ðŸ‘‹

There will be no technical reviews this week (and possibly next week) for two reasons:

1. I didnâ€™t find anything interesting enough to break down (except for two topics: how quantum computers work and a new hypothesis on reconciling quantum mechanics with special relativityâ€”but these are too long and complex to cover alongside point #2);
2. Exam week has started, so Iâ€™ll be preparing...

See you soon...

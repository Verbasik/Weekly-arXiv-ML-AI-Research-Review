## üìù Description

This repository contains a detailed overview of the new open protocol **Agent2Agent (A2A)**, unveiled by Google at the Google Cloud Next '25 conference (April 9, 2025). A2A is a standardized protocol designed to enable secure interaction between artificial intelligence agents across different platforms, frameworks, and vendors. Unlike existing solutions for AI agent workflows, A2A specifically focuses on inter-agent communication, complementing other protocols such as Anthropic‚Äôs Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## üîç Key Features of the A2A Protocol

- **Leverage Agent Capabilities**: Supports natural interaction between agents without requiring shared internal memory or context;
- **Built on Existing Standards**: Uses HTTP, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and JSON-RPC for seamless integration;
- **Security by Default**: Built-in support for enterprise-grade authentication and authorization mechanisms;
- **Support for Long-Running Tasks**: Capable of handling both rapid-response tasks and extended processes with real-time feedback;
- **Modality Independence**: Supports diverse data formats, including text, audio, video, and other content types.

## üìä Technical Architecture and Core Components

### Communication Mechanism

- **HTTP**: Fundamental request/response protocol for interactions;
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: Enables one-way real-time data streaming;
- **JSON-RPC**: Standardizes structured method calls between agents;
- **Client-Server Model**: Clear separation of roles between client and server agents.

### Key Data Structures

- **Agent Card**: Describes an agent‚Äôs capabilities, authentication requirements, and supported content types;
- **Task**: Central object representing a work request between agents;
- **Message**: Represents conversational exchanges between agents;
- **Artifact**: Outputs and results generated from task execution;
- **Part**: Autonomous blocks of content in various types (text, files, data).

### Core Protocol Functions

1. **Capability Discovery**: Mechanism for agents to discover each other and determine available capabilities;
2. **Task Management**: Standardized lifecycle for tasks from creation to completion;
3. **Collaboration**: Structured information exchange between agents;
4. **User Experience Negotiation**: Adaptation of data formats based on agent capabilities.

## üìà A2A vs. MCP Comparison

| Features | A2A (Agent2Agent) | MCP (Model Context Protocol) |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **Primary Goals** | Interaction and collaboration between agents | Connecting agents to external tools and resources |
| **Type of Interaction** | Agent-to-agent | Agent-to-tool/resource |
| **Key Entities** | Client agent, remote agent | Agent, MCP server, tool |
| **Communication Style** | Dynamic, consultative, supporting unstructured interactions | Structured, request-response, tool-calling oriented |
| **Data Structure Focus** | Agent Card, Task, Artifact, Part | Tool definition, function call/response, resource schema |
| **Typical Use Cases** | Multi-agent task decomposition, cross-system workflow automation | Agents using external APIs and databases |

### Advantages of A2A

- Enables cross-platform communication between agents;
- Facilitates collaboration within multi-agent systems;
- Designed specifically for enterprises with enterprise-grade security requirements;
- Uses standard web formats to simplify integration;
- Strong support from Google Cloud‚Äôs partner ecosystem.

### Potential Issues and Limitations

- Security concerns, particularly regarding rapid injection attacks;
- Potential redundancy compared to existing REST standards;
- Dependence on broad industry adoption for maximum effectiveness;
- Need for further development of security mechanisms for multi-agent systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implications

The A2A protocol unlocks new possibilities for creating more autonomous, interactive, and productive AI agent systems capable of:

- Automating complex business processes across disparate systems;
- Combining specialized agents to solve intricate tasks;
- Building scalable multi-agent architectures with support for long-running operations;
- Integrating agents from multiple vendors into a unified ecosystem.

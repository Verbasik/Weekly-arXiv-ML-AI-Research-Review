## 1. Introduction

Eso-LMs represent a significant breakthrough in generative language modeling, successfully unifying autoregressive (AR) and masked diffusion model (MDM) paradigms for the first time. While autoregressive models such as GPT excel in generation quality but suffer from slow sequential inference, masked diffusion models offer parallel generation capabilities but traditionally lag in perplexity and lack efficient caching mechanisms. This work eliminates these fundamental limitations by proposing a unified architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches while minimizing their respective weaknesses.

The diffusion phase (orange) progressively removes noise from tokens in parallel, while the sequential phase (green) fills remaining masked tokens autoregressively with rich conditioning from both left context and clean tokens discovered during diffusion.*

## 2. Background and Motivation

The language modeling landscape is dominated by autoregressive models, which generate text sequentially from left to right. Although these models achieve excellent perplexity scores, their sequential nature limits inference speed and flexibility. Masked diffusion models emerged as an alternative, offering parallel token generation and improved controllability, but they face two critical challenges: slower inference due to bidirectional attention preventing KV caching, and a noticeable quality gap compared to AR models.

Recent hybrid approaches, such as Block-Denoising and Diffusion Language Models (BD3-LMs), attempted to bridge this gap by combining autoregressive block modeling with intra-block diffusion. However, these methods suffer from mode collapse at low sampling steps and provide only partial caching benefits. This study identifies these limitations as key barriers to the practical adoption of diffusion-based language models.

## 3. Core Methodology

### Hybrid Training Objective

Eso-LMs introduce a novel training structure that smoothly interpolates between AR and MDM objectives via a hybrid loss function. The key innovation lies in formulating a variational bound:

This loss combines an autoregressive term (computed for originally masked tokens) with a masked diffusion term (a weighted average over progressively noised sequences). The hyperparameter $α_0$ controls interpolation: $α_0=1$ yields pure MDM behavior, while $α_0=0$ results in pure AR behavior.

### Two-Stage Sampling Process

Generation proceeds in two distinct phases:

1. **Diffusion Phase:** Starting from a fully masked sequence, the model gradually removes noise from a subset of tokens in parallel, producing a partially masked sequence $z_0$. A key optimization processes only clean tokens and those scheduled for denoising at each step, significantly reducing computational cost.

2. **Sequential Phase:** Remaining masked tokens are filled autoregressively from left to right, with each token conditioned on its left context as well as clean tokens discovered during the diffusion phase.

## 4. Attention Mechanism Design

The paper presents two variants with distinct attention mechanisms:

**Eso-LM (A)** uses bidirectional attention among clean tokens during diffusion training, while applying causal attention to masked tokens. During the sequential phase, it employs a custom attention pattern allowing masked tokens to attend to themselves, the clean left context, and clean right context from $z_0$.

**Eso-LM (B)** extends causal attention principles to enable full KV caching on both phases. It enforces causal attention across all tokens based on random permutations during diffusion training, maintaining consistency between attention patterns during training and inference.

## 5. Experimental Results

### Generation Quality

Eso-LMs achieve state-of-the-art perplexity among discrete diffusion models on standard benchmarks. On the One Billion Words dataset, Eso-LM (A) outperforms prior MDLMs by approximately 1 PPL even in pure MDM configuration ($a_0 = 1$). The ability to smoothly interpolate allows precise tuning of the quality-speed trade-off: lower $a_0$ values (more AR-like) typically yield better perplexity, approaching the performance of pure autoregressive models.

### Inference Efficiency

The breakthrough lies in enabling KV caching for masked diffusion models. Eso-LM (B) demonstrates remarkable speedups compared to standard MDMs:

- 14x faster for context length L=2048
- 65x faster for context length L=8192

Compared to previous semi-autoregressive approaches, Eso-LM (B) shows substantial improvements:

- 3.2x faster than BD3-LM (L'=16)
- 3.8x faster than BD3-LM (L'=4) at L=8192

### Pareto Frontier: Speed vs. Quality

Eso-LMs set a new state-of-the-art on the Pareto frontier of speed-quality. Unlike BD3-LMs, which suffer severe mode collapse at low NFE values, Eso-LMs maintain competitive performance across all sampling budgets, demonstrating superior reliability and stability.

### Technical Innovations

**KV Caching for Diffusion Models**

The most significant technical contribution is the successful implementation of KV caching for masked diffusion models while preserving their parallel generation capabilities. This breakthrough eliminates the fundamental limitation that has hindered the practical application of diffusion models for language generation.

**Optimized Forward Pass**

During diffusion sampling, Eso-LMs process only the subset of tokens actually required at each step, avoiding computation over future masked tokens not scheduled for denoising. This optimization, combined with careful attention pattern design, significantly contributes to the observed acceleration.

## 6. Significance and Impact

Eso-LMs represent a paradigm shift in generative language modeling, successfully unifying two previously separate approaches. The work demonstrates that the traditional trade-off between generation quality and inference efficiency can be overcome through careful architectural design and training methodology.

The introduction of KV caching for diffusion models has profound implications for the practical deployment of these models. The demonstrated speedups make diffusion-based language models viable for real-time applications and long-context generation tasks where they were previously impractical.

Beyond immediate performance gains, this research opens new avenues for future work in hybrid generative architectures. The smooth interpolation between AR and MDM behaviors provides a flexible foundation for developing models tailored to specific application requirements—whether prioritizing quality, speed, or controllability.

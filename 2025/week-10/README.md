Hi everyone! Today I want to introduce you to a review of the **Evo-2** model, developed jointly by **NVIDIA** and the **Arc Institute**. This is not just another AI — it’s a genuine breakthrough in biology that changes the rules of the game.

## What is Evo-2?

**Evo-2** is the largest AI model for biology, trained on **9.3 trillion DNA base pairs** from a curated genomic atlas spanning all forms of life. Imagine an LLM (language model), but instead of text, it operates on DNA. The model can:

- 📖 **Read and interpret** complex genomic sequences, including non-coding regions.
- 🧬 **Generate** entire chromosomes, novel genomes, and predict disease-causing mutations.
- 🧪 **Design** synthetic life from scratch, programmable proteins, and potential gene therapies.

## Why is this important?

**Evo-2** transforms biology from a descriptive science into a computational one. Now we can do more than just study life — we can design it. This opens the door to creating new drugs, synthetic organisms, and even modeling entire cells.

## How does it work?

The model uses **StripedHyena 2** — a hybrid architecture combining convolutional operators and attention mechanisms. It learns autonomously, capturing even weak interactions in DNA, such as exon–intron boundaries.

## Key features:

- 🟢 **Evo-2 (7B and 40B)** — processes up to **1 million base pairs** in a single contextual window.
- 🟠 **Evo-2 Base (1B, 7B, 40B)** — works with sequences of length **8192**.
- 🧪 The model has already successfully generated **synthetic yeast chromosomes** and **mitochondrial genomes**.

## Open access

The project is fully open: model weights, code, and the **OpenGenome2** dataset are available to all. This means anyone can contribute to the advancement of synthetic biology.

## What’s next?

**Evo-2** is only the beginning. We stand on the threshold of a new era where AI becomes a tool for designing life. The question remains: how will we choose to use this power?

## 📚 About the Project

This repository is a weekly collection of reviews of papers from arXiv 📰 and Hugging Face 🤗 in the fields of: 🤖 Machine Learning, 🧬 Bioengineering, and ⚛️ Physics. Each week, I select significant publications for in-depth analysis and practical implementation.

### 🚀 Project Sections

#### 1️⃣ Weekly Research Brief (The Weekly Research Brief)
The main section featuring reviews of scientific papers, published every Sunday.

#### 2️⃣ Agents-Under-Hood
Deep practical breakdowns of multi-agent systems:
- 🔧 Analysis of open-source frameworks (AutoGen, LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- 🖥️ Reviews of MCP (Multi-agent Computing Platform) servers
- 📐 Architectural patterns for designing agent systems
- 💻 Practical examples with source code

#### 3️⃣ ATLAS: Algorithm Templates for Live AI Scripts
Interactive visualizations of classic machine learning algorithms:
- 📚 Jupyter Book with mathematical derivations "from scratch"
- 🔄 Interactive Notebooks (Jupyter/Marimo)
- 📊 Visualizations from derivatives to neural network training

### 🎯 Project Goals:
- Systematic study of cutting-edge research in ML/AI
- Creating accessible and clear reviews of complex scientific works
- Practical implementation of described methods and algorithms
- Building a knowledge base for researchers and enthusiasts
